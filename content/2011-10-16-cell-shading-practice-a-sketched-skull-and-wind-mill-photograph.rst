**Some of my resent works using my Ubuntu + Wacom Bamboo + MyPaint +
Gimp Workflow!**

First some cell shading practice. Inside MyPaint I only used two colors
in my palate but to gain shadow and depth I used variations of opacity.
This technique produces a neat cartoon effect.

Next I sketched a skull. I attempted to keep all my strokes in the same
direction. This piece is monotone. I used only one color and deviated
each layer with different opacity settings.

Last is a photograph I snapped during a family outing. I had to lower
the quality of this image to prepare for use on the web, but I still
adore the colors spectrum of this shot. The white birch tree frames the
right side while the grass and brush frame the bottom. The wind mill was
intentionally placed in the center with the apex extending upward. The
ivy creeps up the structure and the cloud filled sky appears to stretch
forever. The foliage emits a euphoric glow under the sun saturated rays.
