After dinner tonight, Carter, my four year old asked me, "If I swallow lots of air will I be lighter?". I thought about the question for a moment and then told him it depends on what surrounds you.

If you are surrounded by: 
 * air and you swallow lots of air you will not be lighter.
 * water and and swallow lots of air you will be lighter, relative to the water, and you will float better.
 * helium and you swallow lots of air you will become heavier, relative to the surrounding helium.

Whaaaaaat???!!?!1!
