**Recently while surfing pandora** I stumbled upon a new favorite song,
"Think Straight Again", composed by a ska band named The Barrymores.  I
embraced the bands alluring melodies after the first play.

**What caught my attention?**

Well the whole band rocks, *hard*.  The main components of The
Barrymores shape a full and energetic sound.  They have a drummer,
a bassist,  a lead guitarist and two horn players (trumpet and
trombone).  Oh, I almost forgot to mention they contrast most ska bands
by featuring a kickass lead female singer.

**What compelled me to write about The Barrymores?**

Though The Barrymores are a small town band, their technical abilities
and prowess mimic more a band of a major record label.  Their rocking
upbeat style is similar to other ska bands.  Each track creates a
euphoric sensation and even the "sad" songs feel uplifting. When The
Barrymores are on my stereo I typically end up chanting the lyrics while
skanking around my office.  I feel they bring the ska punk rock genre
into another level of excellence.

**And then I found the depressing news ...**

I started researching The Barrymores because I was fascinated with their music.
This research inevitably lead to some depressing news,
The Barrymores are no longer together! 

    "I Am Jack's Broken Heart" -Fight Club.

Not often do I get excited about new music.
In moments I grew attached to the group only to get crushed.
I decided to investigate to uncover more.

Apparently The Barrymores went into hiatus after one of the founding
members passed away.   The
Barrymore \ `myspace <http://www.myspace.com/thebarrymores>`__ page
still seems active and continues to hosts a few of the bands tracks.

Sorry about the bummer, but you should still give the music a listen.
