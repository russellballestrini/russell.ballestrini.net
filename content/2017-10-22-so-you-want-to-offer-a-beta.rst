My number one suggestion: gather interest as soon as possible, maybe even before your `MVP (minimal viable product) </how-do-i-calculate-the-m-in-my-mvp>`_.

Right now, I'm in the process of running a beta for `Remarkbox <https://www.remarkbox.com>`_ and here is what I learned:

    Collect information from potential customers, engaged in research mode.

Don't just ask for an email address, have them fill out a short survey right away.
If you only ask for an email, your out of luck if you need more information; people will not answer questions after the fact.

I know, I know ... nobody likes to fill out surveys, so increase their motivation with an incentive or discount. Use this survey to earn qualifed leads, remember quality over quantity.

Come up with a few questions. Keep most of the questions open ended; let the survey start the dialog. Use the responses to break the ice later on when you email people one-on-one. Take advantage of each leads unique situation and keep your on boarding emails personal!

**tl;dr** gather interest ASAP and ask questions up front as part of the sign up.
