I'm running a beta for `Remarkbox <https://www.remarkbox.com>`_ and my biggest take away:

    Collect information from a potential customer as soon as possible â€” 
    Catch them in active pursuit of a solution to their problem.

Don't just ask for an email address, have them fill out a short survey right away.
If you only ask for an email, your out of luck if you need more information; people will not answer a question after the fact.

I know, I know ... nobody likes to fill out surveys, so increase their motivation with an incentive or discount. Use this survey to earn qualifed leads, remember quality over quantity.

Come up with a few questions. Keep most of the questions open ended; let the survey start the dialog. Use the responses to break the ice later when you email one-on-one. Take advantage of the unique situation each lead presents and keep your on boarding emails personal!

**tl;dr** gather interest ASAP and ask questions up front as part of the sign up.
