Warning / Update!
======================

This post was originally written from a place of jealousy and bitterness.

Turns out I was wrong about this transaction and for better-or-worse, Facebook 
(and Mark Zuckerburg) solidified their edge as the king of social for the last 6 years.

Original Post
======================

**Facebook purchased Instagram on Monday, April 9th 2012 for
$1,000,000,000 US.** Instagram, a free to use image sharing iPhone
application, has absolutely NO REVENUE STREAM. The application is free
to download, free to use, and has no monetization support from
advertisements.

    $1000000000.00 / 30000000 users = **33.33 per user**

At the time of the sale Instagram had 30 million users in total
(30,000,000). That means Facebook just paid heavy **$33.33** per user...
This is obviously a bad deal for Facebook.

Instagram did not have a method to monetize its application. I hedge my
bets that Facebook will never recoup the one billion dollars spent on
this deal.

Mark Zuckerburg, I just thought up the perfect T-Shirt for you:

    **I just purchased Instagram for 1B and all I got was this lousy
    image filter.**
