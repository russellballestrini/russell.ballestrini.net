If career development was a game of chutes and ladders, job networking
would be the ladder. They provide a shortcut to the top, a direct route
to win your dream job.

At work today, a colleague was reviewing resumes for an open requisition
within the unix group. I decided later that night to clean up `my
resume <http://russell.ballestrini.net/uploads/2011/10/Russell-Ballestrini-Resume.pdf>`__
to make it more relevant. I felt like I did something positive for my
career. After coming down from the high of resume writing I began to
question rational. I then came to the contradictory conclusion that a
great resume holds less importance than a mediocre recommendation.

It is better for an employer to learn about you from a recommendation
then your resume. Why? Hiring new people holds risk. A hiring manager
will reduce risk by promoting from within or using personal
recommendations. In both cases the resume becomes a document of
formality instead of a document of credentials. 

    "Its not what you know, its who you know."

What can we assume about the position they are extending to the public?
We can safely assume that the manager has already hired somebody for the
high risk, enjoyable position and is now looking for a bottom feeder
with a resume to fill the newly vacant position. Keep this in mind the
next time a head hunter sends you a job proposition email.

Normally taking shortcuts goes against conventional wisdom for success.
Job networking however, allows candidates to skip ahead and arrive at
their dream occupation more directly. Meeting new people seems like the
single best way to land a job doing what you love.
