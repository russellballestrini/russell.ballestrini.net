**ATT Uverse Residential Gateway Broadband LED flashes red
intermittently**

I have struggled with my uverse Internet and TV service randomly and
intermittently shutting off for the last 3 months. When this occurs the
Residential Gateway's broadband LED flashes red.

Also I get Uverse DSL link errors:

When I 'live support chatted' with the uverse technical support they
claimed I had bridge tap on my lines, and that my lines had other
'issues'.

They had to dispatch 3 technicians before one of them figured out the
problem. It turns out I had a faulty 'voice/data' splitter.

I snapped a picture of the demarcation box before and after he replaced
the faulty splitter.
