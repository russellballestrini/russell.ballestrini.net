**Last night I decided to learn how to use git for its popularity and
github to code more socially.**

I have to admit early on that I enjoy hg and bitbucket so it came to a
surprise that github would have me jump through hoops to create a new
repository...

Below I have copied the seemingly bloated github instructions for
creating a new project.

**Github:**

#. create project/repo using the form
#. mkdir scratch
#. cd scratch
#. git init
#. touch README
#. git add README
#. git commit -m 'first commit'
#. git remote add origin
#. git@github.com:russellballestrini/scratch.git
#. git push -u origin master

Wow...

I like my method better.

**My Github clone hack:**

#. create project/repo using the form
#. git clone
   https://russellballestrini@github.com/russellballestrini/scratch.git

Awesome, 2 steps versus 10. That hack appears 80% more efficient! Now if
only my name was shorter... LOL
