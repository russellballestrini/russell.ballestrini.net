**Recently I have contemplated the idea of building a screen capture
service for websites.** I anticipate the service would provide
functionality similar to Google's "Instant Preview". I also pondered the
idea of archiving the screen captures and providing a history similar to
the internet Wayback Machine.

After floundering on my first web application,
http://four2go.gumyum.com, I'm afraid to spend lots of time and energy
on another project if I cannot earn users or customers.

I feel the market segment for this type of service would include website
directories, live portfolio generation for website designers, and
websites in general for people who wish to keep track of the overall
look of their site over time.

As an MVP I plan to build a free live web capture application to
basically provide a "Gravatar" for website addresses.

**Do you think anyone would use my MVP or service?**

**Have I missed any other market segments?**

LinkPeek provides an easy to use API which enables anyone to instantly
create live web page thumbnails. We provide the API free of charge,
think of LinkPeek as Gravatar for web addresses.
