Nearly 6 years ago I launched the beta for `LinkPeek, a web page screenshot service <https://linkpeek.com>`_. After all this time, I'm writing to share something new I've been passionately working on called Remarkbox.

I started working on `Remarkbox <https://www.remarkbox.com>`_ back in 2014 to solve a problem I had after moving my `Wordpress blog to a static site </migrating-from-wordpress-to-pelican/>`_. I knew my readers would still want to communicate with me so I started the search for the **perfect embeddable comment system** to promote discussion.

My research found solutions which would slow down my site, or worse, serve ads! That very day, I set out to build my own solution because -

    "How long could it take to build a comment system?"  ... 

3 years later, I'm finally ready to share Remarkbox: a hosted comment service that embeds in your pages to keep the conversation in the same place as your content.

Remarkbox increases user engagement because it:

* enables a visitor to discuss your content right away without needing an account
* supports Markdown and a realtime *as-the-user-types* preview of the comment
* supports deeply nested replies and has a really clean user interface
* has blazing fast page load speeds

... and the best part, absolutely **NO ADS!**

I'm in the process of hand selecting group of users to help me test. Would you be interested in joining a list to hear more about it?

`Yes! I would like to follow the Remarkbox journey. <https://www.remarkbox.com#beta>`_
