Five months ago during my preparation and ramp up to gardening season, I started thinking about what it would be like to have a partner, a side kick, a secretary to keep me honest and on task.

Somebody who could review old journal notes from previous years and give me hints about what seeds I should be starting, what worked well, what didn't and why.

I started thinking I'm likely not alone and that other hobby and market gardeners likely feel the same way. I then expanded this, likely anyone bootstrapping a small business "enterprise" could use a side kick. Small craft brewers, artists, sign makers, the list goes on and on.

As you might know I'm deeply interested in systems like computer science and permaculture. Computer scientists often try to model complex natural systems. Often natural systems give us clues on how to make computers perform certain tasks.

One reoccuring theme I find between computer science and permaculture is the idea of inputs and outputs.

Brewing wine from berries requires the following inputs: boiling water, berries, sugar, yeast, and yeast nutrient. Combined all these inputs together in the right way, wait for a certain time, and the system returns an a tasty, alchoholic, product with a long shelf life as an output. The spent berries are not wasted either, this goes straight into the compost for next years garden. Natural systems and unnatural systems model after natural ones, have no waste by-products (pollution). Every output of one process is always an input of another.

Only when we mess up the natural order of organic systems do we end up with polution. Polution is simply a holistically bad output. For example, when we artifically produce outputs, like plastics there is no natural system to take it as an input, it becomes polution and makes the system sick.

To fight off the production of unnatural outputs, like single use plastics, we need to create other human managed systems to use the pollution as inputs. For example, I'm insulating my shed with bags of single use polyethylene wrappers that wrap my families purchases. I'm keeping the valuable (although un-natural) resource out of the waste stream and using it to shrink the tempurature swing deltas in my shed. When we model the material world as inputs and outputs we can learn how to best use what we have on hand.

I think we can give our local economies a great unfair advantage if we gave the proper tools to the local gardeners, brewers, and makers.

This is why today I'm announcing gigsidekick an app to to change the world for the better and flip the script on globalization and large enterprise giants.

GigSideKick is a simple to use "app" which is used in the "field" without getting in the way of work. I think the most basic and simple app would simply help journal the inputs and outputs of a system and allow the user to set ETAs on when a process should be finished (and later power reminders).

I think every local hero deserves the unfair advantage that a smart and capabile sidekick would provide.

This type of input/output journal should not interfere with the task at hand, and would only require a few button presses. The data created from such a journal would be hugely valuable to the user's future self, and if properly aggregated and crowd sourced this data could power a recommendations engine.

For example, a person subscribing to a "garden" knowledge pack might get the following recommendation: "gardeners in your area are known to typically start on average of 24 zucchini seeds this month, which typically result in 18 viable zucchini seedlings in 6 days". "How many will you start?"

The data would also be used to track human labor (which itself is a very value input), track inventory of parts, work-in-process, and finished goods, and could ultimately help the local hero market and trade or sell thier finished products. After all, if you have a surplus of apples without a good output, it will end up as an input to the compost pile instead of an input to the bellies of deserving humans. : )

I beleive in giving power back to local communities and economies. As small businesses and side gig heros we need all the help we can get to compete in today's global economy. Local makers have an unfair advantage that we are not exploiting, and that's the fact that we don't need to ship our goods, we just need to figure out how to market our superior products (outputs) to local people who will swing over to buy or trade.

We also have the unfair advantage of using or trading our by-products, we can even trade our waste. For example I as a gardener would gladly trade a bucket of leaves, coffee grounds, sticks, sawdust, or grass clippings for a heaping bowl of beyond orgainic salad greens! It's honestly the timeless addage of "one mans trash is another mans treasure". Your waste outputs are very useful inputs of the correct system. Local people trading outputs is by far the best thing we can do for our planet.
