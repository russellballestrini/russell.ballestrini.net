**Connecticut killed affliate marketing with Amazon.com**

I just opened my amazon account and read this:

    | Account Closed
    |  This account is closed and will not generate referrals. Access to
      this site is for historical purposes only.

When I checked my email, I had this letter from Amazon.com:

    Hello,

    For well over a decade, the Amazon Associates Program has worked
    with thousands of Connecticut residents. **Unfortunately, the budget
    signed by Governor Malloy contains a sales tax provision that
    compels us to terminate this program for Connecticut-based
    participants effective immediately.** It specifically imposes the
    collection of taxes from consumers on sales by online retailers -
    including but not limited to those referred by Connecticut-based
    affiliates like you - even if those retailers have no physical
    presence in the state.

    **We opposed this new tax law because it is unconstitutional and
    counterproductive. It was supported by big-box retailers, most of
    which are based outside Connecticut, that seek to harm the affiliate
    advertising programs of their competitors.** Similar legislation in
    other states has led to job and income losses, and little, if any,
    new tax revenue. We deeply regret that we must take this action.

    **As a result of the new law, contracts with all Connecticut
    residents participating in the Amazon Associates Program will be
    terminated today, June 10, 2011.** Those Connecticut residents will
    no longer receive advertising fees for sales referred to Amazon.com
    , Endless.com , MYHABIT.COM or SmallParts.com . Please be assured
    that all qualifying advertising fees earned on or before today, June
    10, 2011, will be processed and paid in full in accordance with the
    regular payment schedule.

    You are receiving this email because our records indicate that you
    are a resident of Connecticut. If you are not currently a resident
    of Connecticut, or if you are relocating to another state in the
    near future, you can manage the details of your Associates account
    here . And if you relocate to another state after June 10, 2011,
    please contact us for reinstatement into the Amazon Associates
    Program.

    To avoid confusion, we would like to clarify that this development
    will only impact our ability to offer the Associates Program to
    Connecticut residents and will not affect their ability to purchase
    from www.amazon.com .

    | We have enjoyed working with you and other Connecticut-based
      participants in the Amazon Associates Program and, if this
      situation is rectified, would very much welcome the opportunity to
      re-open our Associates Program to Connecticut residents.
    |  Regards,

    The Amazon Associates Team

**Summary**

-  Amazon.com does not have a facility in CT.
-  CT passed a new bill.
-  The bill declares: if a customer from any state clicks on a CT
   resident's affiliate link and purchases an item, that
   customer/Amazon.com should have to pay CT tax.

**My Opinion**

-  This seems bad.
-  I have less money to spend in Connecticut.
-  This smells like double taxation.
-  One more reason to move out of Connecticut when looking for Tech or
   IT jobs.
