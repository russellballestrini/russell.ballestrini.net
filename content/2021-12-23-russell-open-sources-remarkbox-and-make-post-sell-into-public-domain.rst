Merry Christmas & Happy Holidays, Everyone!

My wife prompts students with this fun holiday writing idea:

    **"If you could gift the world anything, what would it be?"**

I love to read responses in the comments!

**As for me, I have wonderful news, my dream gift to the world will come true this year!**

For the holiday season, I AM gifting to the public domain my most essential code in hopes to trigger a **positive trend of doing in 2022**!

    **"in 2022, dream & do!"**

For each project I have linked to the guide on how to find the source code:

I will continue to operate the SaaS under Remarkbox and MakePostSell trademarks & operations will fall under unturf.

I hope to facilitate the growth of a team of volunteers to maintain the code in the commons.

Sharing code without a team is a vulnerable position.

I've imagined some paths & potentialities and found myself wanting to **"open"** up. 

**Risk:**
Alice may finally read the code & find vulnerabilities, 
burning a hole between us so we cannot seem to reach an
end crippling our communication & taking down the whole system.

**Solution:**
More eyes on problems, more environments in wild, more solutions communicated.

**Risk:**
The masses may fork & divide the perfect circle.

**Solution:**
We volunteer to grow & multiply our systems, not worry about forks.
We avoid focus on those who ignorantly mutilate or divide, instead
we focus on helping project ideas sprout, multiply, & thrive!

At a high level this ``unturf`` stack consists of the following:

* HTML
* CSS
* Python
* SqlAlchemy
* Sqlite3
* Pyramid
* uwsgi
* Nginx
* Postfix
* letsencrypt
* Object Store (boto3)

And of course we dogfood:

* MakePostSell
* Remarkbox

For analytics we host our own:

* Plausible

If the documentation is doing it's job, people should be able to use the services without understanding the fundementals of each of the keywords listed above.

The writing of this essay has unfolded liberation in me and so, 
I speak words in favor of Truth, Freedom, and Love.

I AM now free to Grow, Explore, Document, and Multiply!

Have a great day fellow reader!

I love you!
