Russell Builds Products
########################

:slug: about

Hey there, welcome to my little slice of the Internet!

*You may view a list of my active projects below the text.*

Finding **simple solutions** to difficult problems, gives me a rush. 

I feel like I'm at my best when I can turn ideas into products. I often prototype using Python and admire readable, testable code. The process of refactoring is like a crossword puzzle to me and brings me joy.

As a strong advocate of opensource, I donate my code and time when I can.

I currently work for `Remind <https://www.remind.com/>`_ as a software engineer where I write software to manage infrastructure running in AWS.

My long term goal is to work for myself. My first successfully bootstrapped product launch was `LinkPeek <https://linkpeek.com>`_ which I still operate today. Right now I'm actively bootstrapping `Remarkbox, a hosted comment service <http://www.remarkbox.com>`_.

You should `contact me </contact>`_. I love conversation and often respond in a timely manner!
