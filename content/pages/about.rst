Russell Builds Products
########################

:slug: about

Hey there, welcome to my little slice of the Internet!

*You may view a list of my active projects below the text.*

I get a rush out of **finding simple solutions** to difficult problems. 

I keep busy by turning ideas into products.
Most often I prototype and code using Python but I'm flexible and often explore other languages.
I admire readable, testable code and I thoroughly enjoy the process of refactoring.

I'm a strong opensource advocate and so when I can, I donate my code and time to that cause.

My first successful product launch was `LinkPeek <https://linkpeek.com>`_ which I still operate today. I'm actively bootstrapping `Remarkbox, a hosted comment service <http://www.remarkbox.com>`_.

I currently work for `Remind <https://www.remind.com/>`_ as a software engineer where I write software to manage infrastructure running in AWS.

If you read all that, you should likely `contact me </contact>`_. I love conversation and always responds in a timely manner!
