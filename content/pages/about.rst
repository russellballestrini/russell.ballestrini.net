:slug: about

Hey there, welcome to my little slice of the Internet!

*You may view a list of my active projects below the text.*

**Finding simple solutions to difficult problems, gives me a rush.**

I feel at my best when I turn ideas into products or services. I often prototype using Python and admire readable, testable code. For me, the process of refactoring brings me joy. As a strong advocate of opensource, I donate code and time when I can.

I currently work as a Software Engineer, writing software to manage infrastructure running in "the cloud", but I also have a basement full of real computers and servers.

I value Truth, Freedom, and Love. I want to find financial independence to retire myself from unvoluntary work. Once accomplished, I want to help others reach freedom from unvolntary work. As a result, right now I'm actively bootstrapping `Make Post Sell, a platform for people to sell digital downloads online for as cheap as possible. I do this by keeping a careful eye on capacity engineering and optimzing key operating costs.

You should `contact me </contact>`_, I love conversation and often respond in a timely manner!
