**I cancelled my xbox live automatic renewal today because I no longer
use the service.**

I find humor in Microsoft's list of reasons to keep Xbox live:

**6 out of 8 services above are FREE Internet services!**

If I want to use those free Internet services on my TV,
I'd rather use my tiny media center PC (`nT330i <https://www.foxhop.net/nT330i>`__)
which is amazing and near silent.

Microsoft prevents subscribers from cancelling their service over the
web, and thus they forced me to call their service center. After waiting
5 minutes I finally spoke to a sales representative who seemed friendly
and understanding.

She asked me why I wanted to cancel automatic payments. I explained "I
want to pay month to month". After listening to my position the sales
representative offered **1 month of Xbox Live for $1.00.** So I'll have
Xbox live until December 2011 after all.

Microsoft, give your users a web browser on the Xbox and stop trying to
sell subscriptions to Free Internet services.

***PlayStation 3 launched with a web browser and a FREE network.***

**UPDATE:** If you opt into the $1 for one month deal, you are also
opting back into the automatic renewal program... Even if the person on
the phone tells you otherwise.
