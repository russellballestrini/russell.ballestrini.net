Nearly 6 years ago I launched the beta for `LinkPeek, a web page screenshot service <https://linkpeek.com>`_. After all this time, I'm writing to share something new I've been passionately working on called Remarkbox.

I started working on `Remarkbox <https://www.remarkbox.com>`_ back in 2014 to solve a problem I had after moving my `Wordpress blog to a static site </migrating-from-wordpress-to-pelican/>`_. I knew my readers would still want to communicate with me so I started the search for the **perfect hosted comment system** to promote discussion.

My research found solutions which would slow down my site, or worse, serve ads! That very day, I set out to build my own solution because -

    "How long could it take to build a comment system?"  ... 

3 years later, I'm finally ready to share Remarkbox: a hosted comment service that **embeds in your pages** to keep the conversation in the same place as your content.

Remarkbox **increases user engagement** because it:

* allows a visitor to discuss your content right away without an account
* supports **Markdown** with real-time comment previews
* supports deeply nested replies and has an orderly user interface

... and the best part - fast page load speeds and absolutely **NO ADS!**

I'm in the process of hand selecting group of users to help me test. Would you be interested in joining a list to hear more about it?

`Yes! I would like to follow the Remarkbox journey. <https://www.remarkbox.com#beta>`_
