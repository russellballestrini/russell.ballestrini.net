**The Great Gist Heist**

I have crawled, downloaded, and archived all of gist.github.com. Please
hear my story before jumping to conclusions.

**Why?**

I'm currently building software that requires a large corpus of source
code.

I began to search for a collection of source code documents but my
pursuit appeared fruitless. Feeling displeased I attempted to gather all
of my own source code. My collection lacked fidelity perhaps because of
my revere for the python language.

Regardless of the reasoning, I needed a higher quantity of samples. I
needed unbiased samples from all programming languages. I needed, most
importantly, samples in a variation of quality that only the most
popular paste sites have... sites like gist.

**Why are you sharing it?**

I feel a little bad about using Github's bandwidth.

Sharing this collection should reduce the chances that others will crawl
for the same data. If you need a large collection of source code,
`download this torrent </uploads/2011/08/the-great-gist-heist.torrent>`_.

**How did you do it?**

I wrote a short, 30 line, python script. The script is part of the
torrent.

At the peak of the scrape I had 14 threads running of the script, using
approximately 580Kbps (I used iftop).
