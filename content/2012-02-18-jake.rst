  My Adventure Time art, painted with MyPaint and wacom tablet.

**Jake from Adventure Time, painted with MyPaint and wacom tablet.**

I did this because my 4 month old "cracks-up" laughing whenever this
character is on screen. I think the combination of colors and Jake's
voice, played by John William DiMaggio, get him going.

**Finn from Adventure Time.**

Took a shot at painting Finn.
