The companion `webwords git repo <https://github.com/russellballestrini/webwords>`_ lives here.

This project shows how to code the same minimal web app called ``webwords`` in as many different programming languages as possible.
It also provides a guides for building and running ``webwords`` as a docker image.

.. contents::

what is webwords
================

A simple web application whose spec accepts the following two query parameters â€”

keyword:
 The ``keyword`` you want to search for.

target:
 The URI ``target`` that you want to search.

The application always returns an ``HTTP 200`` response and the string ``true`` or ``false`` depending on if the keyword is found in the ``target`` web page body.

Once you have the application running inside docker, run this command to get the exposed port:

.. code-block:: bash

 docker ps

To see if a ``keyword`` exists on a ``target`` web page, put the follwing in a browser:

.. code-block:: txt

 http://127.0.0.1:32779/?keyword=potato&target=https://www.remarkbox.com

In this example we check if the keyword ``potato`` is on the web page https://www.remarkbox.com 

Spoiler:
 it is

Note:
 You will need to replace the port of ``32779`` with the port from the ``docker ps`` output.


why is webwords
===============

Webwords started as a programming Kata to practice writing code in different programming languages. Each port of webwords should behave the same to make comparing and functional testing simple.


**why did you choose this programming problem?**

I think the spec of webwords is small enough for people new to any language to digest but complete in that it does something useful and demonstrates two common tasks: running an HTTP server and using an HTTP client.

Also, I needed a way to verify if a user had posession of a domain name for the `comment service <https://www.remarkbox.com>`_ I'm building called Remarkbox. I decided to make this verification program a micro service, first with Python and later with Go. The result was webwords. 

Shortly after during a hackathon I used webwords to learn how to build Docker images for various languages and formalize the idea into a single project. 


**What's next?**

Webwords is for tinkering. If you want to add a version or touch up an existing version, send a PR.
Maybe a future fork will show a guide for adding a cache layer or teach how to add logging or gather metrics.


go
========

To build the docker image:

.. code-block:: bash

 cd go
 docker build -t webwords-go .

To run a test container from the new image:

.. code-block:: bash

 docker run -d -p 8888 webwords-go

python
========

To build the docker image:

.. code-block:: bash

 cd python
 docker build -t webwords-python .

To run a test container from the new image:

.. code-block:: bash

 docker run -d -p 8888 webwords-python


ruby
========

To build the docker image:

.. code-block:: bash

 cd ruby
 docker build -t webwords-ruby .

To run a test container from the new image:

.. code-block:: bash

 docker run -d -p 8888 webwords-ruby


js
========

To build the docker image:

.. code-block:: bash

 cd js
 docker build -t webwords-js .

To run a test container from the new image:

.. code-block:: bash

 docker run -d -p 8888 webwords-js

debugging
=========

If you're anything like me, your programs rarely compile or work properly on the first try.
Just like with programming, a docker image will rarely build correct the first time so you will need to learn how to debug.

To debug, get the failed docker container's id:

.. code-block:: bash

 docker ps --all

Once you have the id, you can run the following to see the error:

.. code-block:: bash

 docker logs <container-id>

Debug the issue, fix your ``Dockerfile``, and retry the build process until you have it working.

You can delete old attempts by running:

.. code-block:: bash

 docker rm <container-id>
