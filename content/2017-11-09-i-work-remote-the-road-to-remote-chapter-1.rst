Chapter 1: The Road to Remote
=================================================

So you have made up your mind, you want to work from home. The first step to attaining this goal is to make it a priority.

The suggestions and advice in this book come from my life experiences. Not all of my experiences will apply to you but I hope that we might find, together, at least a single thread of universal truth. In order to know, I think it makes sense to briefly review the anatomy of my life from childhood until now.

I'm currently 32 years old, but I started working with computers at a very young age. As an elementary schooler, I had a very bright childhood friend named `Brian Brennan <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlO2_GecWo8>`_ who though younger than I, was my first mentor regarding computers. At age 9 we played lots of video games, original playstation and Nintendo 64, as well as countless hours of computer games on his Gateway computer. At one point Brian learned how to make the computer work for him instead of other the other way around. Together we started learning HTML and Javascript. I didn't have the Internet on my family computer at the time, but my parents did have a WebTV so I started building HTML web pages for things I enjoyed and used the WebTV to upload my pages Geocities.

Flash forward to age 13, I finally had dial-up. Now we didn't pay for dial-up, in fact my parents didn't know I was "connected" as we used to call it, but I was. I had the "setup" credentials for our regional phone company — I was living the dream of free Internet! I covertly routed speaker wire from our pantry closet to the computer room. Yes, I learned early on that in a pinch you can use speaker wire as telephone wire, although I don't recommend it. This was one of many hacks I stumbled on. Hacks (the combination of science, trial & error, and creativity) are a common theme through out my life.

I spent my highschool career building HTML pages instead of powerpoints for school projects. At home I built my own computers out of parts, as so many of us did back then and gamed all night during LAN parties where we traded "warez" and "pr0n". I was 15 when we got an A-DSL connection running on 125kbps down / 15kbps up. I started hosting my websites from my house on a Windows server hiding in my bedroom closet. Later this server was reborn running FreeBSD 3. Most of my highschool education was spent figuring out how to get out of class and into either the computer lab or the library with friends were we would basically meet as an informal computer or tech club. For more details about this era, checkout my long time friend Charles Hooper's `"How I hacked my high school" <http://www.charleshooper.net/blog/how-i-hacked-my-high-school/>`_ blog post.

When I was going to community college for Computer Science, I worked two part time jobs — I worked for my parents and separately at a large retail chain in the electronics department, where I slung "HDTVs". I was working 40 hours a week, doing 4 courses a semester, and I didn't have time for anything. I mostly resented my mall job. I hated how cruel companies were and how they actively shit on their employees. I spent my lunch breaks in Borders reading computer and business books. I started hosting my parent's small family business website which I coded by hand.

In between Calculus and selling TVs, I also found time to build the best damn real estate search engine a local agency in south Eastern CT could buy.
I was taken advantage of, I worked at least 500 hours on that site which was commissioned for about $500. I did however learn a _lot_ about business and tech. I was brave and dumb and took on more then I could chew but it was successful. Hands down it was the best solution on the market at the time, this was long before Zillow existed.

While working in the retail store, I met George, an IT guy working for my region's pharmaceutical company. George referred me to a job making $18/hr migrating Windows 2000 computers to Windows XP. I accepted the contracting job thinking I was on the top of the world, I finally had a "real" computer job. I did awesome work but what I didn't know was this world is cruel to contractors. They don't get sick time, they don't get vacation, and they certainly don't get respect. Contractors are fed lies and false promises and they are the first to get cut. Managers treat contractors like physical resources. It's honestly sick.

From there I moved to a technical call center helpdesk, also as a contractor, of a contractor, of a contractor of the DoD. If you follow the money, I was making $17/hr but at the top of the pyramid they were billing me out at $55/hr.

After from time I managed to move onsite successfully cut out one of the contractor layers. I still lacked negotiation skills and confidence so only made $18/hr as a desktop support tech. I fixed computer problems whether it was software or hardware, I was fast and could basically solve anything handed to me. I quickly transitoned to a desktop support engineer role where I learned how to package and push software to small fleets of computers. A couple years later I transitioned to Unix server team.

Each step was a very big promotions as far as responsibility (I was one of two employees who designed and operated a multimillion dollar Hitachi SAN) but my pay didn't budge. People were coming off the street for the same or worse position and making more then double. At the time I was making $32k a year and people were joining at $65k a year ... After being shit on for so long, this was the tipping point, this is where I started to shift my thinking.

I felt stuck. I worked for both the big industries for my region and they both failed me. I knew I did not want to relocate but I didn't want to work for companies with obsene priorities and shitty culture.

    The only way to move up is to move out.

I started moonlighting on side projects. I had so many flops and failures, to many to count. Finally I launched an idea with traction called `LinkPeek <https://linkpeek.com>`_. During my code development phase of building LinkPeek I became active in the open source community for the framework I was using called `Pyramid <https://trypyramid.com/>`_.

I didn't know what it was called at the time, but I was networking. I started to learn some tricks to `career development </career-development-is-a-game-of-chutes-and-ladders/>`_ and ended up meeting a hiring manager who appreciated my skill and was willing to take a chance with me working remote. I flew across the country to Santa Monica and had a bit of culture shock but I landed the position!

This victory would be the first of 4 remote positions I have held since finally taking the leap to "work from home".

Tune in to the next chapter where I discribe how I positioned myself to win the interview.
