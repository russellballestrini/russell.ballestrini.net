**As you may have noticed, I recently switched this blog over to the
ChaosTheory Wordpress theme.**

I had to tweak some of my pre-existing articles to make them look
'right' but upon completion I was very pleased with the aesthetics of
each page.

Later on I reviewed the theme of foxhop.net, my pylowiki demo site.
Pylowiki felt bland in comparison to this wordpress blog.

So, I made up my mind to build themes for Pylowik, and I started by
porting ChaosTheory. You can view the finished product at
`http://www.foxhop.net <%20http://www.foxhop.net%20>`__.

You should also give Pylowiki a try. Pylowiki has futuristic, live
preview, same page, section edit functionality.
